## Description

```
One of our biggest client has been hit...again, our DFIR team just sent us what looks like the malware that they use to bypass their EDRs and Firewalls, your tasks:
    - Make an IOC.
    - A full report of the malware internals.
    - Try to fingerprint the malware for attribution, this looks like an APT work.
But before all of that, we want to know what they were after and what they got so far, luckily for you one of the compromised server was capturing network during the attack.

Here are the files, reverse away!
